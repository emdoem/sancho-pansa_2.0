# Phase 1: Discovery & Requirements (Week 1)

Start with a brief discovery phase to clarify your app's purpose:

    Define the problem you're solving and target users

    List core features vs. nice-to-haves (use MoSCoW: Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have)

    Write functional requirements as user stories with acceptance criteria

    Document non-functional requirements (performance, security, accessibility, browser support)

    Identify technical constraints or dependencies

# Phase 2: Design & Architecture (Week 1-2)

Before coding, plan your technical approach:

    Sketch wireframes or create mockups for key user flows

    Define your data model and API endpoints

    Choose your tech stack specifics (which React patterns, state management, backend framework)

    Document architectural decisions (ADRs - Architecture Decision Records)

    Plan your folder structure and component hierarchy

# Phase 3: Development Setup (End of Week 2)

Prepare your development environment:

    Initialize your repository with proper .gitignore and README

    Set up your React + TypeScript project (Vite or Create React App)

    Configure linting (ESLint) and formatting (Prettier)

    Set up CI/CD pipeline basics

    Create your requirements storage system (GitHub Projects, Notion, etc.)

# Phase 4: Iterative Development (Week 3+)

Build in small, testable increments:

    Prioritize your user stories/requirements

    Work in short sprints or cycles (1-2 weeks)

    Build one feature end-to-end before moving to the next

    Write tests as you go

    Regular commits with clear messages linking to requirements
