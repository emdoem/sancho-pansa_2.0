# Wireframe Descriptions for Key Screens

## Screen 1: Main Dashboard / Library View

### Purpose: Central hub for your entire music collection

### Layout (typical desktop application, ~1440x900px):

    Left sidebar (~250px wide):

        Library Statistics (total tracks, storage used, duplicates found)

        Navigation menu: All Tracks, Artists, Albums, Playlists, Duplicates, Settings

        Device sync status (which devices are synced)

    Main content area:

        Spreadsheet-style track listing with sortable columns:

        Action buttons above table: "Scan for Duplicates", "Rename Files", "Import Playlist"

        Pagination/infinite scroll at bottom

    Bottom status bar: Total selected items, available actions

### Key interaction: Users can select tracks, sort/filter, and launch key operations

​
## Screen 2: Initial Folder Selection & Scan

### Purpose: First-time setup to catalog music files

### Layout:

    Center-focused dialog (modal over main screen):

        Large heading: "Select Your Music Folders"

        Folder selection area with "Add Folder" button

        List of selected folders with remove (X) icons

        Preview: "X folders selected, estimated Y files"

        Checkbox options:

            "Include subfolders"

            "Watch folders for changes"

            "Read extended metadata (slower but more accurate)"

        Large primary button: "Start Cataloging"

### During scan:

    Progress bar with percentage

    Current file being processed (with path)

    Statistics updating in real-time: files found, metadata read, duplicates detected

    "Pause" and "Cancel" buttons

    ​

## Screen 3: Duplicate Detection Results

### Purpose: Review and manage duplicate files

### Layout (most critical screen for your app):

    Top filter bar:

        Dropdown: "Group by: Artist & Title | Album & Title | All Metadata"

        Checkbox filters: "Exact matches only", "Similar length (±5 sec)"

        Info badge: "X duplicate groups found, Y files can be removed, Z GB can be freed"

    Main area - Duplicate Groups (card-based or accordion layout):

    Each duplicate group shows:

    text
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │ ● Artist Name - Track Title                         │
    │   Album: [Album Name] | Length: 3:45                │
    │   [2 duplicates found]                        [Expand]│
    └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

    When expanded:
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │ ○ Keep this   File 1                                │
    │   Path: /Music/Artist/Album/01-track.mp3           │
    │   Bitrate: 320kbps | Size: 8.5 MB | Format: MP3    │

    │ ● Remove      File 2                         [Preview]│
    │   Path: /Downloads/track.mp3                        │
    │   Bitrate: 192kbps | Size: 5.2 MB | Format: MP3    │
    └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

    Radio buttons let user choose which to keep

    Bottom action bar:

        "Select All Recommended" button

        "Apply Changes" (primary button) - opens confirmation dialog

            Bottom toolbar:

                "Export to M3U"

        ​

## Screen 6: Device Synchronization

### Purpose: Manage portable database and sync across devices

### Layout:

    Sync dashboard:

        Visual representation of devices (icons for each PC/laptop)

        For each device:

            Device name

            Last sync time

            Status: "In Sync ✓" or "Changes pending"

            Track count comparison

    Sync options:

        Database location: [Path selector] "Store on: Dropbox / Google Drive / External Drive"

        Sync settings:

            "Sync playlists"

            "Sync library state (keep/remove decisions)"

            "Sync metadata edits"

            "Sync naming convention settings"

        Conflict resolution strategy:

            Radio buttons: "Newest wins" | "Manual merge" | "This device is master"

    Manual sync button: "Sync Now" with last sync timestamp

### Critical feature: Clear indication of sync status and conflict warnings before applying changes
